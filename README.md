# ghc-a11y-workshop-2024
Welcome to our A11y + Prompt Engineering workshop! Here you'll find our demo code. There are quite a few accessibility issues with this website. Can you use your new prompt engineering strategies to learn to fix them all?

Try it yourself: https://jsfiddle.net/Morgan123/0h5xypew/

## Prompt Engineering Strategies
1. Prime the chat. \
Example: Always respond using these requirements.

2. Give the AI assistant a role. \
Example: You are a web accessibility expert in charge of evaluating the accessibility of a website.

3. Define target audience. \
Example: Your target audience is the developers of the website.

4. Define requirements / give context. \
Example: The website must meet the AAA level of WCAG 2.2. Use reputable sources such as w3.org.

5. Sanity check the response. \
Be responsible: make sure you understand all of the code that you're writing. Be aware that AI can hallucinate.

>text-decoration: none;
>background-color: #F6C1C9;
>width: 200px;
>}
>
>img {
>width: 50%;
>margin: 10px;
>}
>
>Evaluate this css for web accessibility, considering color blindness and visual impairment. Suggest changes to improve my websiteâ€™s accessibility.
>```
### Challenge 2
Craft a prompt to add alternative text to the images on your website. 
>```
>Alt text is a concise description (up to 150 characters) that conveys the meaning of the image. Given this image, generate alt text.
>```

### Challenge 3
Write a prompt to improve keyboard accessibility. 
>```
>I will provide you with the HTML code of the website. Review it for keyboard accessibility and suggest improvements. 
>```
Copy and paste the HTML code into copilot.
