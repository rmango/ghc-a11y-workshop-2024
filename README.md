# ghc-a11y-workshop-2024
Welcome to our A11y + Prompt Engineering workshop! Here you'll find our demo code. There are quite a few accessibility issues with this website. Can you use your new prompt engineering strategies to learn to fix them all?

Try it yourself: https://jsfiddle.net/Morgan123/0h5xypew/

## Prompt Engineering Strategies
1. Prime the chat. \
Example: Always respond using these requirements.

2. Give the AI assistant a role. \
Example: You are a web accessibility expert in charge of evaluating the accessibility of a website.

3. Define target audience. \
Example: Your target audience is the developers of the website.

4. Define requirements / give context. \
Example: The website must meet the AAA level of WCAG 2.2. Use reputable sources such as w3.org.

5. Sanity check the response. \
Be responsible: make sure you understand all of the code that you're writing. Be aware that AI can hallucinate.
